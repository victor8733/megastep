Playing With Megastep
=====================
While the :ref:`Minimal Environment <minimal-env>` tutorial is extremely detailed, it's not particularly *fun*. This 
tutorial instead takes an existing interesting environment and tasks you to adapt it in specific ways. In solving
these tasks, you'll learn how megastep is structured while hopefully keeping the problem-solving part of your brain
from losing interest.

At the bottom of the page are some links to :ref:`resources <playing-resources>` you might find helpful with these.

Run the Demo
************
:ref:`Install megastep <install>` and record an untrained :mod:`~megastep.demo` agent::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = explorer.Explorer(1)
    agent = Agent(env).cuda()
    demo(env=env, agent=agent, length=64) 

TODO-DOCS Demo video

Swap Out The Geometry
*********************
Copy and paste the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env and replace the default toy geometry
:ref:`geometry <geometry>` with :mod:`~megastep.cubicasa` geometry. Plot it to check that it works::

    env = AlteredMinimal()
    env.display()

TODO-DOCS cubicasa geometry

Triangular Geometry
*******************
Read the :github:`toy geometry code <megastep/toys.py>` and alter it to write your own triangular-box geometry. Try 
it out with :func:`~megastep.geometry.display`::

    from megastep import geometry
    geometry.display(tri)

TODO-DOCS Triangular geometry

Change the Lights
*****************
Copy and paste the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, and replace the :func:`~megastep.scene.scenery` 
call with your own function. Have this function first call the original scene function, but then modify its baked
lighting to be all 1s. Check that it works with :func:`~megastep.scene.display`::

    from megastep import scene
    scene.display(bright)

TODO-DOCS Illuminated textures

Change the Colours
******************
Copy and paste the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, and replace the :func:`~megastep.scene.scenery` 
call with your own function. Have this function first call the original scene function, but then modify its 
textures to be all white. Check that it works with :func:`~megastep.scene.display`::

    from megastep import scene
    scene.display(white)

TODO-DOCS White textures

Change the Observations
***********************
Copy and paste the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, and replace the RGB observations 
with a :class:`~megastep.modules.Depth` observation. Alter the ``plot_state`` method so you can see your change in 
action::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = AlteredMinimal()
    agent = Agent(env).cuda()
    demo(env=env, agent=agent, length=64) 

TOOD-DOCS Depth demo

Custom Observations
*******************
**Trickier**. Write a module like :class:`~megastep.modules.Depth` that returns a visualization of *indices* 
of the lines it's looking at. You'll want to read the :class:`~megastep.cuda.Render` documentation.

Check it works by copying and pasting the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, 
then running it through the demo recorder::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = AlteredMinimal()
    agent = Agent(env).cuda()
    demo(env=env, agent=agent, length=64) 

To get this to work, you'll need to update the ``plot_state`` and the observation space too.

TODO-DOCS Seeing by numbers demo

Change the Movement
*******************
Copy and paste the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, and replace the jump-y simple-motion
actions with :class:`~megastep.modules.MomentumMovement`. Check that it works with the demo recorder::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = AlteredMinimal()
    agent = Agent(env).cuda()
    demo(env=env, agent=agent, length=64) 

TOOD-DOCS Smooth movement demo

Custom Movement
***************
**Trickier**. Write a module like :class:`~megastep.modules.MomentumMovement` that teleports the agent in a different
direction depending on which action is chosen.

Check it works by copying and pasting the code for the :class:`~megastep.demo.envs.minimal.Minimal` env, 
then running it through the demo recorder::

    from megastep.demo import *
    env = AlteredMinimal()
    agent = Agent(env).cuda()
    demo(env=env, agent=agent, length=64)

Resources
*********
Here are some tools that might help with these tasks.

:ref:`API reference <api>`
    The API reference describes the details of megastep in one place. If you decide you want to alter the `FOV
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view>`_ of the agents for example, a good way to go about it would be 
    to go to the API reference and Ctrl+F for 'FOV'.

    The API reference also links to the source of the code it's documenting; if you don't find the detail you want
    in the docs themselves, clicking through to the source code will often give you an answer.

:ref:`Concepts <concepts>`
    There are some ideas in megastep - like 'agents' - which turn up in too many places to document them again and 
    again every time they're used. Instead, there's a Concepts page which gives a brief overview of each of these ideas.

:ref:`FAQ <faq>`
    The FAQ tries to preempt some common questions. It remains to be seen how good of a job I've done with it.

:ref:`Tutorials <tutorials>`
    If you're reading this you probably don't want to read the more in-depth tutorials, but they may still be useful
    as something to Ctrl+F through when you're after a specific bit of code.

IPython Help
    You can follow any object in an IPython session `with ? to get the docs for that object, or ?? to get 
    the source code for that object <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/python-ipython-diff.html#accessing-help>`_.

    ?? will also give you the filepath of the code underlying the object, which is useful for the next bit.

Library Breakpoints
    If you're curious how a library is doing a specific thing and just looking at the code isn't helpful, you can 
    use ?? to find the path to the code on your system and open that path in an editor. Then you can `set a breakpoint
    anywhere you want <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#pdb.set_trace>`_! This can be done with ``breakpoint()``
    in Python 3.7, or ``import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`` in earlier versions.
    
    If you're using `autoreload <https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/config/extensions/autoreload.html>`_ then next time
    you run the code, you'll hit the breakpoint. If you're not using autoreload, you'll either have to use importlib
    to manually reload things, or just restart your IPython session.

    On top of pdb's built-in capabilities, I'd also recommend having a look at `extract <https://andyljones.com/posts/post-mortem-plotting.html>`_.

Demos
    The :github:`demo module <megastep/demo/__init__.py>` has examples of two environments and an example of how to 
    train them.
